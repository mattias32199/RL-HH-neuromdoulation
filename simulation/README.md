For running the code:
1. Run the following command in the terminal: sh init_setup_run_once.sh
2. Run starter.py to perform a simulation and verify that everything is working correctly.
  You should be able to visualize the neuron and the simulated membrane potential.
3. The first time you run a neuron simulation, the program may take longer to generate the initial save state.
  Subsequent simulations will run faster.


Common Issues:
1. To run the simulations you need the NEURON software.
  Installing the NEURON software can be tricky. Please refer to their setup guide: https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download, in case init_setup_run_once.sh is not able to install neuron using pip.
