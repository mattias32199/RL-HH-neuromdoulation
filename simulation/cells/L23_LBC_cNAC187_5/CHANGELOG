        small improvements to numpy and pylab use in run.py and run_RmpRiTau.py
1.0.11: Made compatible with python3. Improved README
1.0.10: Increased the current to calculate the Rin to get above the noise level
        for models with stochastic channels
1.0.9:  Every model package now contains a cellinfo.json file with e.g. the
        m-type, e-type, etc.
1.0.8:  Code was added to calculate the Resting Membrane Potential, 
        Input Resitance and Time constant
1.0.6:  Make random number generators use exact same seed as in large network 
        simulation
